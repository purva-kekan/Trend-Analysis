# 🌍 Global Energy Trends (1990–2020) – A Tableau Dashboard Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores **global energy trends from 1990 to 2020**, focusing on **energy production, consumption, CO₂ emissions**, and the **adoption of renewable energy** across regions and countries. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support **sustainable development**, **policy decisions**, and **environmental planning**.

Dashboards were created using **Tableau** to visualize trends at both regional and country levels. The analysis helps stakeholders understand where energy transition is happening successfully—and where more effort is needed.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Topics

- **Renewable energy adoption trends** across regions and nations
- **CO₂ emissions vs. energy production** relationships
- **GDP energy intensity** (energy use per unit of GDP)
- **Wind and solar energy shares** in power generation
- **Comparative energy performance** between developed and emerging economies

---

## 📌 Dashboards & Insights

### 🔹 Regional Energy Trends
- Europe leads in renewable energy integration
- Asia & Pacific sees rising energy demand with growing renewable share
- The Middle East lags in renewable adoption, still fossil-fuel dominant

### 🔹 Country-Specific Analysis
- Germany significantly increased wind & solar post-2000
- The US reduced intensity while maintaining high energy use
- China & India show strong CO₂-output correlation, driven by fossil fuels

### 📈 Key Visuals
- Line charts for **renewable energy growth**
- Scatter plots for **GDP energy intensity vs. consumption**
- Heatmaps and trend lines to illustrate **regional comparisons**

## 📌 Tools Used

- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing
- **.CSV File**: Source of global energy data (1990–2020)

---

## ✅ Outcomes & Recommendations

- **Europe** and **Asia & Pacific** are key drivers of renewable growth.
- **Policy support** is essential in fossil-fuel-reliant regions (e.g., Middle East).
- Corporates and governments must invest in **renewable infrastructure**, **carbon capture**, and **energy efficiency**.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Integrate **machine learning models** to forecast energy trends
- Analyze sector-specific energy usage (transportation, industrial)
- Study **policy impact** on renewable adoption rates
